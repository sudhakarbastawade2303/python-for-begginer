Understanding Lists in Python
A list is a data structure in Python that can store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures.

Key Features of Lists:
Ordered: Items in a list have a defined order and can be accessed by their index (starting from 0).
Mutable: You can change, add, or remove items.
Heterogeneous: A list can store items of different data types.
Dynamic: Lists can grow or shrink as needed.
