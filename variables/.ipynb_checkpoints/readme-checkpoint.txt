What is a Variable?
A variable is a container for storing data. In Python:

You donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Python is dynamically typed.
You assign a value using the = operator.

How to Declare Variables
python

# Example
name = "DevOps"      # String
age = 30             # Integer
pi = 3.14            # Float
is_learning = True   # Boolean

Variable Naming Rules
Names can include letters, digits, and underscores (_).
They must start with a letter or an underscore, not a number.
Variables are case-sensitive.
Example: name and Name are different variables.
Avoid using Python reserved keywords like if, else, while.
Good Examples:

python

my_name = "Python"
age_2024 = 25
_is_active = True
Bad Examples:

python

2name = "Error"       # Cannot start with a number
my-name = "Error"     # Hyphen is not allowed
if = "Reserved Word"  # Cannot use reserved keywords


Type	    Example

Integer	    age = 30
Float	    pi = 3.14
String	    name = "Python"
Boolean	    is_learning = True
List	    fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
Dictionary	person = {"name": "DevOps", "age": 30}
Tuple	    colors = ("red", "green")
Set	        unique_nums = {1, 2, 3}
			

2.0 Dynamic Typing
Variables can change types during runtime:
